## About

The Origami Kernel Manager script is a versatile tool designed to empower users with an array of features, facilitating kernel adjustments, management, and optimization through the command line interface (CLI). It aims to deliver a comprehensive solution for enhancing device performance and customization by providing various settings for kernel fine-tuning.

## Why need a kernel manager?

- Performance Optimization
  - Fine-tune CPU frequencies, governor profiles, and memory management for enhanced system performance.

- Battery Life Improvement
  - Optimize power-related settings to extend battery life by efficiently managing CPU power, power-saving features, and charging control.

- Customization and Features
  - Customize additional features on kernel that not available in your settings, such as display color calibration, Selinux, low memory killer, or advanced network settings.

- Stability and Reliability
  - Switch between different configurations to find a balance between performance and stability, ideal for users experimenting with kernel stuff.

One of feature of Origami Kernel Managers, Charging controller manipulates Android low level (kernel) parameters which control the charging circuitry. Some devices, notably from Xiaomi (e.g., Poco X3 Pro), have a faulty PMIC (Power Management Integrated Circuit) that can be triggered by Charging controller feature. The issue blocks charging. Ensure the battery does not discharge too low.
